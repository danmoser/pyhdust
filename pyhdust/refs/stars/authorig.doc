HILIB Stellar Flux library contents, procedures and summary. HILIB consists of:
UVILIB (1150-10620/5A, 131 spectra),
UVKLIB (1150-25000/5A, 66 with ir spectra, rest with JHK continuum),
UVMLIB (1150-52000/5A,  16 spectra).
******************************************************************************

The file UVILIB consists of 131 spectra covering the wavelength 
range 1150-10620 A, at 5A steps and approximately 10A resolution. Spectra:
  1- 45 are O5-M6V,   including 5 metal-weak & 5 metal-rich G-K V spectra.
 46- 59 are B2-K3IV.
 60-105 are O8-M10III, including 7 metal-weak & 7 metal-rich G-K III spectra.
106-113 are B2-M3II.
114-131 are B0-M2I.

All spectra were formed by combining data from several publicly available
digital libraries of observed stellar spectra, obtained from the
Astronomical Data Centers at Goddard (ADC), or Strasbourg (CDS). Data at
higher resolution was binned down and/or filtered to approximately 10A
resolution. All spectra are grouped by spectral type, luminosity class and
metallicity (see the file tbl3_types.txt). Spectral types were checked
against the SIMBAD data base, and updated where necessary. A few spectra
either have incorrect types or are not of the stated star. Unused spectra
are labelled with a (:) in tbl3_types.txt. All component spectra were
normalised to unity at 5556A, splined onto a uniform output grid
(1150-10620/5A), and set to zero outside their valid regions. They were then
combined using a single pass rejection scheme to reject a few outlying
pixels. Most bad data was explicitely set zero to avoid contamination, and
the included wavelength regions of components were adjusted by reference to
the templates to exclude poorly calibrated data. Some poorly flux calibrated
libraries have their continuua explicitely normalised to the SED template
spectra (SVID and GS). Wavelength regions contaminated by atmospheric
absorption were generally set to zero, but sometimes interpolated through.

Component summary and synthetic UBVRI photometry are listed in the file
tbl2_comp.txt. Filter profiles (see the file tbl7_uifilt.txt) for the U3
filter are from Buser 1978, A&A 62, 411; for B3 and V are from Azusienis &
Straizys 1969, Sov. Astron. 13, 316; for Rc & Ic are from Bessell 1979 (PASP
91, 589), and the zero points are determined by synthetically measuring the
full range of Sviderskiene types, and minimising the deviations of the
measured colors from standard spectral type UBV colors listed in Buser 1978
(A&A, 62, 411) and BVRI colors listed in Cousins 1981 (SAAO circular #6,
p4).  Filter profiles for JHKLL'M (see tbl8_jmfilt.txt) are from Bessell &
Brett 1988, PASP 100, 1134.  Zero points are determined by requiring the
colors of the A0V spectrum in UVMLIB to be zero, and are close to those in
Bessell & Brett.

Local Equivalent Widths (LEWs) and Magnitude indeces (Mg2 and D4000) were
measured using bandpasses derived from Faber, Friel, Burstein & Gaskell
1985, ApJS 57, 211 amongst others, and are listed in the file tbl5_lew.txt.
Bandpasses are listed in tbl4_line.txt.

The SM plotting and vector arithmetic package (The SM Reference Manual,
R.H. Lupton & P. Monger, 1997, http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~rhl/sm/sm.html)
was used to read, display, filter, spline and combine all data.  The SM
macros used (uvi_types.sm, uvkm_types.sm, flam.sm) are available on request,
and can be used within SM to create, edit, display and measure any spectrum.

The flux library is intended to be amenable to improvement and extension 
in wavelength coverage, spectral type and luminosity class, by incorporation 
of additional digital spectral data as they become available.

Each of the 131 flux.dat files contains 3 header lines with a # in the first
column, and several columns of data. The first column is wavelength in
Angstrom, always 1150 - 10620A in steps of 5A. The second column is
F(lambda) for the relevant spectrum, normalised to unity at 5556A. The third
column is the rms flux error on the same scale. Columns 4-N (Nmax=10)
contain the components used, in no particular order. They are identified as
fsv fi fg fk fj fs fp fn fr fd where the letters correspond to the component
listing in columns 2 of tbl2_comp.txt, and each is the average of the
number of components listed there. RMS errors for some of the individual
component averages are listed in the header. The spectrum in column 2 is the
average of each non-zero component, with the rms of the combination in the
third column. Sometimes when there is only one averaged component source
contributing to the spectrum, the rms flux error is taken from that
component average. The optical error oRMS listed in the header understates
the true error, as it is an RMS of averages, not of all components.

Extension to the infrared, UVKLIB 1150-25000/5A (4771 pixels at 5A/pixel),
and UVMLIB 1150-52000/5A (10171 pixels at 5A/pixel).
******************************************************************************

The file UVKLIB consists of the library spectra from UVILIB, extended from
1150A (10620A) to 25000A (at 5A/pixel) using infrared digital spectra
obtained from ADC/CDS. A smooth standard energy distribution (SED) was
generated for each spectrum by splining between flux points created to match
the UBVRI-104-JHKL colors. The point at 10400A is measured from the UVILIB
spectra, the JHKL colors are generically assigned by type, and listed in
tbl6_irstdphot.txt. This was used to spline together the UVILIB spectra with
infrared contributions starting at 14300A (LRV) or redder in 66 mainly
solar-abundance spectra for which infrared digital data are available. For
cases where no infrared spectra are available, this SED itself was used to
extend the library spectrum out to 25000A. This procedure can be extended
out to 52000A for UVMLIB if desired, but UVMLIB currently consists of only
16 spectra for which digital data (cohen) exists.

The macros for each component are in uvkm_types.sm; macro seduk in flam.sm
creates the SED from generic color data in tbl6_irstdphot.txt and the UVILIB
spectrum itself. FlamV in tbl2_comp.txt is the average F(lambda) for each
spectrum within the V filter passband, and is used to compensate for the fact
that the UVI/KLIB spectra are normalised at 5556A, rather than the effective
wavelength (ElamV) of the V filter, which varies for each spectrum.

M giant spectra in UVKLIB include the synthetic M0-M10 MK type spectra from
Fluks et. al. (1994), and are a combination of these and the UVILIB spectra
in the range 1150-10620A. M0-M8 III are the only components where the
1150-10500A data differ between UVILIB and UVKLIB. M9/10 III spectra are
exclusively synthetic spectra from Fluks et. al. (1994) in both libraries.
