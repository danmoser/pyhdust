VI) SIMULATION
	A) STEP = 5						!sets which step is to be run
		2) POST-PROCESSING PHASE		!(STEP = 2,4,5) *** SECOND STEP ***
			a) PHOTONS
				!---------------------------------------------------------------
				! Select the total number of photons, N_f, and the number of 
				! photons per batch, N_batch.  See section IV.A.1.a for more
				! discussion.
				!---------------------------------------------------------------
				N_f	 = 150000000	 !Number of photons per simulation
				N_batch =	 0	 !Number of photons per batch
			b) INPUT FILES
				!---------------------------------------------------------------
				!Attention: if filename is "last", the code will search for the
				!last iteration available and set the filenames accordingly.
				!If Average last iterations is on, the code will make an 
				!average of the last N_average iterations.
				!Note: due to oscilations in the values of the level populations  
				!temperature, best results are achieved when N_average is 
				!an odd number.
				!---------------------------------------------------------------
				Population File = last  !level pops. & electron temps.
				Dust File		= last		  !dust temperature
				Average last iterations = 1
					N_average = 4
			c) WAVELENGTH BINS 
				!---------------------------------------------------------------
				! This section selects the wavelength bins to be used for the 
				! output SED or LINE PROFILE.  Enter the number of spectral 
				! regions to be sampled (N_bands), and provide a list of their
				! names (Bands = 'band name 1', 'band name 2', ...).  The bands
				! are listed in the next section.  Note that the band names must
				! be given in the same order as they appear in the BAND LIST
				! below.  Note that the frequency range of the simulation will
				! be set to span the requested collection of wave bands.  This
				! means that using a high resolution line region in combination
				! with a broad set of continua will likely result in poor 
				! sampling of the line profile.
				!---------------------------------------------------------------
				N_bands = 1
				Bands = 'H10'
%				N_bands = 3
%				Bands = 'VISIBLE','Halpha','Hbeta'
			d) BAND LIST
				!---------------------------------------------------------------
				! Each spectral region (BAND NAME = CONTINUUM or LINE) is 
				! defined by 5 quantities: 
				!  1) the number of bins (Nbins); 
				!  2) the Bin Spacing (0 = linear; 1 = log)
				!  3,4) the Lower and Upper Lambdas in microns if 
				!		BAND NAME = CONTINUUM
				!  3,4) the Line center in Angstroms and Line width in km/s if 
				!		BAND NAME = LINE).  
				!  5) the prefix that will be appended to the output filename
				!  6) the photospheric line profile. The options are:
				!       0 = no changes at the continuum spectrum.
				!       1 = force a flat line profile.
				!       2 = use the file specified at Section (IV.B.b) of the 
				!           input. The code will add all lines profiles present 
				!           within the band spectral range, for the closest 
				!           values of Teff na log(g) of current stellar bin.				            
				!
				! A sample continuum region is:
				!
				!	VISIBLE = CONTINUUM			!Name = CONTINUUM
				!	Nbins = 40					!number of bins
				!	Bin Spacing = 1				!0 = linear; 1= logarithmic
				!	Lower Lambda = .2 um		!lower wavelength of region
				!	Upper Lambda = 1. um		!upper wavelength of region
				!	File prefix = SED_
				!   Add photospheric line profile = 0   !0=cont.; 1=flat; 2=file
				!	SOBOLEV METHOD = 0
				!
				! and a sample line region is:
				!
				!	Halpha = LINE				!Name = LINE
				!	Nbins = 100					!number of bins
				!	Bin Spacing = 0				!0 = linear; 1= logarithmic
				!	Line center = 6564.61 Angstrom !wavelength at line center
				!	Line width  = 1020. km/s		!velocity width of region
				!	File prefix = Ha_
				!   Add photospheric line profile = 1   !0=cont.; 1=flat; 2=file
				!	SOBOLEV METHOD = 1
				!
				! You can add as many new regions to this file as you want, but
				! their names must be unique.  NOTE: As the code reads the 
				! regions, it builds a cumulative, sorted list of the wavelength
				! bins by inserting the new bins into the list.  For this reason
				! you should always define high resolution regions AFTER low 
				! resolution regions in this file.
				!---------------------------------------------------------------
				K BAND = CONTINUUM
				Nbins = 30
				Bin Spacing = 1
				Lower Lambda = 1.85 um
				Upper Lambda = 2.45 um
				File prefix = K_
				Add photospheric line profile = 0

				H10 = LINE
				Nbins = 245
				Bin Spacing = 0
				Line center = 3751.22 Angstrom	 
				Line width  = 1832.5 km/s
